/**
 * This class provides a generic wrapper for arbitrary
 * Timers that may be used with the Timing Framework.
 * Animator creates its own internal TimingSource by default,
 * but an Animator can be directed to use a different 
 * TimingSource by calling {@link Animator#setTimer(TimingSource)}.
 *
 * The implementation details of any specific timer may
 * vary widely, but any timer should be able to expose
 * the basic capabilities used in this interface. Animator
 * depends on these capabilities for starting, stopping,
 * and running any TimingSource.
 *
 * The usage of an external TimingSource object for sending in timing
 * events to an Animator is to implement this interface appropriately, 
 * pass in that object to {@link Animator#setTimer(TimingSource)},
 * which adds the Animator as a listener to the TimingSource object,
 * and then send in any later timing events from the object to the
 * protected method {@link #timingEvent()}, which will send these timing
 * events to all listeners.

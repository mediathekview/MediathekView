/**
 * This class controls animations.  Its constructors and various
 * set methods control the parameters under which animations are run,
 * and the other methods support starting and stopping the animation.
 * The parameters of this class use the concepts of a "cycle" (the base
 * animation) and an "envelope" that controls how the cycle is started,
 * ended, and repeated.
 * <p>
 * Most of the methods here are simple getters/setters for the properties
 * used by Animator.  Typical animations will simply use one of the 
 * two constructors (depending on whether you are constructing a repeating
 * animation), optionally call any of the <code>set*</code> methods to alter
 * any of the other parameters, and then call start() to run the animation.
 * For example, this animation will run for 1 second, calling your
 * {@link TimingTarget} with timing events when the animation is started,
 * running, and stopped:
 * <pre>
 *  Animator animator = new Animator(1000, myTarget);
 *  animator.start();
 * </pre>
 * The following variation will run a half-second animation 4 times, 
 * reversing direction each time:
 * <pre>
 *  Animator animator = new Animator(500, 4, RepeatBehavior.REVERSE, myTarget);
 *  animator.start();
 * </pre>
 * More complex animations can be created through using the properties
 * in Animator, such as {@link Animator#setAcceleration acceleration} and {@link
 * Animator#setDeceleration}. More automated animations can be created and run
 * using the {@link org.jdesktop.animation.timing.triggers triggers}
 * package to control animations through events and {@link
 * org.jdesktop.animation.timing.interpolation.PropertySetter} to 
 * handle animating object properties.

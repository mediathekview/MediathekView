/**
 * This class enables automating animation of object properties.
 * The class is a TimingTarget, and should be used as a target of
 * timing events from an Animator.  These events will be used to 
 * change a specified property over time, according to how the
 * PropertySetter is constructed.
 * <p>
 * For example, here is an animation of the "background" property
 * of some object "obj" from blue to red over a period of one second:
 * <pre>
 *  PropertySetter ps = new PropertySetter(obj, "background", Color.BLUE, 
 *                                         Color.RED);
 *  Animator anim = new Animator(1000, ps);
 *  anim.start();
 * </pre>
 * Here is the same animation, created using one of the utility
 * factory methods that returns an animator:
 * <pre>
 *  Animator animator = PropertySetter.createAnimator(1000, obj, "background", 
 *                                                    Color.BLUE, Color.RED);
 *  anim.start();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * More complex animations can be created by passing in multiple values
 * for the property to take on, for example:
 * <pre>
 *  Animator animator = PropertySetter.createAnimator(1000, obj, "background", 
 *                                                    Color.BLUE, Color.RED, 
 *                                                    Color.GREEN);
 *  anim.start();
 * </pre>
 * It is also possible to define more involved and tightly-controlled
 * steps in the animation, including the times between the values and
 * how the values are interpolated by using the constructor that takes
 * a {@link KeyFrames} object.  KeyFrames defines the fractional times at which
 * an object takes on specific values, the values to assume at those times,
 * and the method of interpolation between those values.  For example,
 * here is the same animation as above, specified through KeyFrames, where the
 * RED color will be set 10% of the way through the animation (note that
 * we are not setting an Interpolator, so the timing intervals will use the
 * default LinearInterpolator):
 * <pre>
 *  KeyValues vals = KeyValues.create(Color.BLUE, Color.RED, Color.GREEN);
 *  KeyTimes times = new KeyTimes(0.0f, .1f, 1.0f);
 *  KeyFrames frames = new KeyFrames(vals, times);
 *  Animator animator = PropertySetter.createAnimator(1000, obj, "background", 
 *                                                    frames);
 *  anim.start();
 * </pre>

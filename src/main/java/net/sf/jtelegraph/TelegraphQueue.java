/**
 * Handles the display of message notifications. This class was created to
 * act as a message notification manager. Please note that this message
 * notification manager handles the calls for methods of the
 * <code>net.sf.jtelegraph.Telegraph</code> class. After adding a message
 * notification to the queue, there is no need of calling any methods of the
 * message notification itself. Check the following example:
 * @code
 * Telegraph telegraph = new Telegraph("Connection status", "The DB connection was established successfully", TelegraphType.NOTIFICATION_DONE, WindowPosition.BOTTOMLEFT, 4000);
 * TelegraphQueue queue = new TelegraphQueue();
 * queue.add(telegraph);
 * @endcode
 * If there is no notifications in the queue, the message notification is displayed
 * right after the call of the #add() method. Otherwise, it will be queued
 * until there is no notifications in display. Please note this is a simple
 * <i>first in first out</i> queue, so no priorities are estabilished when
 * adding notifications.
